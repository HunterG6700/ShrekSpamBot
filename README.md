# iMessage Lyric Bot

​

This repo goes along with [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/wEkkZBY2Ja4).  I edited it to make it sync up to the shrek thme song. It sends texts using Twilio.
Copy and paste song lyrics, movie scripts, etc into the lyrics file. Add your friend's phone number to the num file, run, and watch as it sends texts one by one, for every word!
